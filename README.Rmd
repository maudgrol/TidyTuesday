Welcome to my #TidyTuesday repo. At the start of 2021 I decided that I will take part in these data projects to further build my data visualization skills with real-world data. Clicking on a plot will take you to the code I wrote to build it. You can find me on [twitter](https://twitter.com/maudgrol) or [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/maud-grol-8033b312/) if you would like to get in touch.  


## #TidyTuesday
[TidyTuesday](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday) is a weekly data project aimed at the R ecosystem. Although an emphasis is placed on understanding how to summarize and arrange data to make meaningful charts with ggplot2, tidyr, dplyr and other tools in the tidyverse ecosystem, any code-based methodology is welcome. Every week a raw dataset, a chart or article related to that dataset is posted, and people are invited to explore the data. The goal of TidyTuesday is to apply R skills, get feedback, explore otherâ€™s work, and connect with the greater #RStats community!

My first ever TidyTuesday project, showing that there is a big gender gap when it comes to acquiring artists' work.
